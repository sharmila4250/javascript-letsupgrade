  console.log("The Boolean Data Type:The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off ");
  console.log("The Null Data Type:This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value.A null value means that there is no value." );
  console.log("The Object Data Type:The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.")

  console.log("The Array Data Type:An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.");
  console.log("The typeof Operator:The type of operator can be used to find out what type of data a variable or operand contains. It can be used with or without parentheses (typeof(x) or typeof x).");
